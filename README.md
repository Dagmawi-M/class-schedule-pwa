# Class Schedule PWA Client
This project is implementing the [Class Schedule backend](https://github.com/brukberhane/class-schedule_ASP-Server) and attempting to be a mobile first project while being able to grow into a desktop solution in the future as well.

## Dependencies
* node/npm
* yarn

## Building for Development
First clone the repo and then run `yarn install` inside the project folder. Once that's complete you're good to go.

## Running Locally
* `yarn run`

## State of the Project
I'm going to be working on this project fairly often as it's a passion of mine and I've been wanting to implement something like this for a while. But because of constraints with work and school I might not be able to do as much as I'd like.
